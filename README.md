PCB - 555 timer piano - link { https://365.altium.com/files/C8FBC0CE-C92D-11EB-A2F6-0A0ABF5AFC1B }
This toy was made by taking picture of  "Physics of Music" into consideration now to understand the physics of music let's look at the image on the left.

there are total of 12 different basic notes in the piano so to generate this 12 different tones we have to generate 12 different frequency signals (signal can be of any form sine wave or square wave but remember square wave gives better tones compared to sine wave) . LMC555 TIMER is used to generate different frequency signals as we know that frequency output of a 555 timer is dependent on combination of resistors and capacitors  (Ra,RB AND C) so by making two components fixed (i.e Ra and C) and varying Rb we can generate different frequency signals.
